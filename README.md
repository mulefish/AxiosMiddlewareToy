# AxiosMiddlewareToy

A toy to demonstrate how to use axios middleware to put a JWT token into outgoing RESTful calls.

# Why so complex? Axios middle ware is not that hard?

Needed a functioning backend to demo/create the front end.

# Why the strange structure?

Because this was born as a client ( react ) + server ( node express ) but it evolved into a dead simple react + a complex server - So I just deleted the react. In the server directory is the servers ( all 3 need to run ) and the one html page.

# What next?

Go into the server directory - that is where the interesting stuff is.
